		<h1>
			Feynman
		</h1>
		<p>
			An opera by composer Jack Vees, Operations Director of the Yale Center 
			for Studies in Music Technology, and librettist Paul Schick, Artistic 
			Director of RTO. Its subject is the Nobel Prize-winning physicist and 
			cult figure Richard Feynman. The amazing 
			<a href="http://www.sopercussion.com" target="_blank">SO percussion</a>, 
			often cited as the best ensemble of its 
			kind, provides the orchestra backing a solo Dr. Feynman (sung by baritone 
			Michael Cavalieri) onstage. Following the highly acclaimed premiere at 
			the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival, CT, in June 2005, we were delighted 
			to present further performances in Brattelboro, VT, at the Vaughan 
			Recital series at Dartmouth College, and as a free public performance as 
			part of the Walker Lecture Fund in Concord, NH. In December 2005 we 
			staged Feynman in New York City at the Knitting Factory; a venue 
			challenge like no other, which resulted in a stunning new visual 
			interpretation of the work and further critical acclaim. We are also 
			planning future performances in the US and Europe.Â
