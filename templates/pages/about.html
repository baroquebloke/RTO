	Real Time Opera is a performing arts organization dedicated to the production 
	of new opera. Founded in 2002, it is based in Oberlin, Ohio, and produces 
	opera across the United States, engaging professional singers and a range of 
	instrumental ensembles for performances at a wide variety of venues. Previous 
	productions include the world premieres of Korczak's Orphans by Adam 
	Silverman and Susan Gubernat (2003); Hawaiian Tan Ratface, with words and 
	music by John Trubee, at San Francisco's Studio Z, accompanied by the Ugly 
	Janitors of America and featuring choreography by Carl Franzoni (2004); and 
	Feynman (2005), by composer Jack Vees and librettist Paul Schick, at the 
	Norfolk Chamber Music Festival and at The Knitting Factory in New York City, 
	featuring S≈ç Percussion. RTO's co-production (with the Oberlin Conservatory) 
	of Leave me Alone!, written by Harvey Pekar and Dan Plonsey and performed at 
	Oberlin's Finney Chapel in 2009, was the first-ever world premiere opera to 
	be webcast live. The widespread attention it received included a segment on
